```
Then create a Pull Request on GitHub.

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Java Code Style
- Use meaningful variable and method names
- Follow Java naming conventions (camelCase for variables/methods, PascalCase for classes)
- Add comprehensive comments explaining complex logic
- Keep methods focused and single-purpose
- Use functional programming patterns where appropriate

### Documentation
- Add JavaDoc comments for public methods
- Include inline comments for complex logic
- Update README.md if adding new examples
- Maintain consistent formatting

### Example Structure
```java
/**
 * Brief description of the example
 * 
 * This example demonstrates [specific concept] using functional programming.
 * It shows how to [specific use case] in a practical way.
 */
public class YourExample {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("=== Your Example Title ===\n");
        
        // Example 1: Basic concept
        demonstrateBasicConcept();
        
        // Example 2: Advanced concept
        demonstrateAdvancedConcept();
    }
    
    /**
     * Example 1: Basic concept demonstration
     * 
     * This method shows [specific concept] with clear examples.
     */
    private static void demonstrateBasicConcept() {
        System.out.println("1. Basic Concept:");
        
        // Your implementation here
        
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```
